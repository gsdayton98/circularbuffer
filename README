Welcome to CircularBuffer

CircularBuffer is a static sized double ended queue that wraps around.  Read
from the tail pointer. Write to the head pointer.  When either pointer reaches
the end of the buffer, it wraps around to the beginning.  The buffer is full
when the head wraps around to the tail, and empty when the tail is the same as
the head.

CircularBuffers are handy for communicating between threads.

This version is merely an example using modern C++11 and C++17 features.

The unit testing makes use of the CppUnitXLite framework (https://github.com/gsdayton98/CppUnitXLite.git)
